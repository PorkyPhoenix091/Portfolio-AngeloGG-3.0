description: Listening to "Memories of Paris" a sweet neoclassical piece for
  felt piano, it is possible to travel the streets of the city with the mind,
  recognizing its sounds, shapes, colors, smells, it is possible to perceive the
  lively and brilliant colors of the city. The notes intertwine like the threads
  of an impressionist painting, conveying the sensations of walking along the
  Seine. Sensations and memories come together in a sweet melody. Thus forgotten
  emotions and feelings are captured.
