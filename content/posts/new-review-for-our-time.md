Listening to "Memories of Paris" a sweet neoclassical piece for felt piano, it is possible to travel the streets of the city with the mind, recognizing its sounds, shapes, colors, smells, it is possible to perceive the lively and brilliant colors of the city. The notes intertwine like the threads of an impressionist painting, conveying the sensations of walking along the Seine. Sensations and memories come together in a sweet melody. Thus forgotten emotions and feelings are captured.
