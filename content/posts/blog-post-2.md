Time is an objective and subjective dimension of our existence. What we perceive as the passage of time influences our life, decisions, and emotions. Our relationship with time is deep and personal, raising philosophical questions about its nature and meaning. Time is an inexorable force that accompanies us.\
The melody is played on a felt piano. Its rhythm recalls the passage of time with a melodic line that evolves in tune with it.
